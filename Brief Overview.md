# Data-Visualization
the code uses matplotlib library, along with seaborn and sklearn library, to create customized data visualizations and contains the following procedures:

read and describe the data in csv file | plot histogram | produce correlation matrix | plot scatterplot matrix | plot boxplot (side-by-side) | linear regression | plot residuals | customize visualizations

this piece more specifically focuses on generating the statistical summary of the data; ploting histogram for a certain attribute in the dataframe; creating correlation matrix and scatterplot matrix for numeric attributes; ploting side-by-side boxplot for an attribute grouped by another attribute; analyzing the numbers and graphs; ploting scatterplot and superimposing linear regression; displaying residuals of the data used in regression
